I am a Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](http://cispa.saarland/), co-supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.saarland/people/backes/) and [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). My research interests include biomedical privacy and machine learning privacy.
Prior to joining CISPA, I graduated from Zhejiang University (ZJU) with the Master's degree of Control Science and Engineering in 2017 worked at Network Security and Privacy Protection (NESC) Lab, supervised by [Prof. Peng Cheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cp).
I am interested in different areas of security & privacy.
